# Disaster Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based Disaster Prediction System with two main modules:
- **Earthquake Prediction Module**
- **Multi-Disaster Prediction Module** (for floods, cyclones, wildfires, etc.)

The aim is to provide early predictions that can help authorities and communities prepare for potential natural disasters.
