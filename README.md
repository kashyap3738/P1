# Disaster Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based Disaster Prediction System with two main modules:
- **Earthquake Prediction Module**
- **Multi-Disaster Prediction Module** (for floods, cyclones, wildfires, etc.)

The aim is to provide early predictions that can help authorities and communities prepare for potential natural disasters.

##  Features

### 1. Earthquake Prediction Module
- Uses seismic data to predict potential earthquakes.
- Implements machine learning algorithms for time series analysis and classification.
- Visualizes risk zones and prediction probabilities.

### 2. Multi-Disaster Prediction Module
- Covers various disasters including:
  - Floods
  - Cyclones
  - Wildfires
  - Landslides
- Integrates data from multiple sources such as weather APIs, satellite data, and historical records.
